Write a RISC-V program that finds the maximum value in an array of signed halfwords (`.half`) given the start address and the length.
Assume that `length >= 1`.
It should be equivalent to the following C code.
```
short findmax(short array[], int length) {
    short max = array[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < length; i++) {
        if (array[i] > max) max = array[i];
    }
    return max;
}
```
