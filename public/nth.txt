Write a program in RISC-V assembly that accesses position `idx` in the integer array `array` and stores the result in the memory location `out`.
(`out = array[idx]`)
Fill out the rest of this code which will get called with different values.
```riscv
.data
	out: .word -1
	idx: .word 2
	array: .word 3, 4, 5, 6
.text
```
